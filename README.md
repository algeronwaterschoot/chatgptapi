Use ChatGPT as an API.

This project is still very much in alpha and is only meant as a proof-of-concept to talk to ChatGPT via javascript.

How to use:
- Install as a Chrome extension.
- Go to chat.openai.com/chat (or use a CORS unblocker)
- Click the extension button
- Click the test button and enter a message you want ChatGPT to answer

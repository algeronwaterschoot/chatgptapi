# chatgptapi
Use chat.openai.com's free API instead of api.openai.com's pay-per-token version.

This project is still very much in alpha and is only meant as a proof-of-concept.

How to use:
- Install as a Chrome extension.
- Go to chat.openai.com/chat (or use a CORS unblocker)
- Click the extension button
- Click the test button and enter a message you want ChatGPT to answer
